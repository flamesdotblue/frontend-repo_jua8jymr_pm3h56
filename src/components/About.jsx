              I'm a developer and builder, with a background in full stack development â€” but I enjoy going beyond just writing code. Over the years, Iâ€™ve taken on roles in project management, worked with data, and generally leaned into whatever challenges helped move a project forward. I like wearing different hats, learning on the go, and finding practical ways to bring ideas to life.

              What drives me most is the process of building â€” from concept to execution â€” and learning through doing. Whether it's crafting a user experience, diving into backend logic, or aligning teams around a product goal, I enjoy being involved across the stack and beyond.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-white/85">
              Outside of that, I love exploring new technologies, especially in the fast-moving world of AI. Iâ€™m always experimenting, tinkering, and seeing whatâ€™s possible â€” not because I have to, but because I genuinely enjoy the ride.
